# testlib
This project contains C++ implementation of the testlib. It already used on many programming contests in Russia (Russian National Olympiad in Informatics, different stages of ACM-ICPC). Join!

The library C++ code is tested for compatibility with Borland C++ (5.6), Microsoft Visual C++ (2003+), g++ (MinGW 4.0.2). Also we don't hear any issues about incorrect work with other compilers.

This code used many times on Open Team Programming Collegiate Cup contests (http://opencup.ru/) running on Linux platform and compiled by g++ compiler.
